                <div class="uncenter">
                    <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The invention of the Closed-Circuit Television, also known as CCTV, by Walter Bruch in 1942, was first used to monitor V-2 rockets during World War II. Nowadays, this device monitors, prevents, and reduces criminal activity in business establishments, houses, and other places. It is proven effective as the camera provides evidence of crimes, which allows security organizations to track the culprit more efficiently and results in a psychological effect that reminds people of security measures (Kelly, 2012). Thus, the presence of the CCTV camera helps to eliminate the fear of citizens that a crime will happen, giving a better sense of security and protection. However, surveillance footage from CCTV drives are poor in quality and have low resolution. Aside from this, CCTV cameras are short ranged devices and can only view limited spaces and short distances. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Aquila Chrysaetos, commonly known as the eagle, is considered to have the best vision within the animal kingdom. Compared to humans, with perfect eyesight of 20/20, Eagles' standard is 20/5, meaning it can see at a distance of 20 feet what a human with 20/20 vision would need to be at a distance of 5 feet to see. To add to their impeccable visual acuity, Eagles also have better color and near panoramic vision, among other visual qualities, meaning that their eyesight is at least four times better than humans. This is because their eyes have structures and modifications better suited for their environment, giving them an advantage over other animals (2021).</p>
                    <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Due to the advanced structures eagle eyes have compared to a human's eye, we can use the similarities between the CCTV camera and a human's eye (ex: structure of the lens, memory space, among others). Thus, we aim to modify the CCTV camera to achieve better quality by using the likeness of an eagle's eye.
