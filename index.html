                <div class="uncenter">
                    <p>The invention of the Closed-Circuit Television, also known as CCTV, by Walter Bruch in 1942, was first used to monitor V-2 rockets during World War II. Nowadays, this device monitors, prevents, and reduces criminal activity in business establishments, houses, and other places. It is proven effective as the camera provides evidence of crimes, which allows security organizations to track the culprit more efficiently and results in a psychological effect that reminds people of security measures (Kelly, 2012). Thus, the presence of the CCTV camera helps to eliminate the fear of citizens that a crime will happen, giving a better sense of security and protection. However, surveillance footage from CCTV drives are poor in quality and have low resolution. Aside from this, CCTV cameras are short ranged devices and can only view limited spaces and short distances. </p>
